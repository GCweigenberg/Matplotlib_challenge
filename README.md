In this task, I was given access to the complete data from a  recent animal study. In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of certain drugs of interest against other treatment regimens.

I was tasked with generating all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the clinical study. Lasty, I completed a brief summary of the study results.
